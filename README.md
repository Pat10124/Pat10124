# About me:

### Hello there! My name is Patrick Campbell. I'm a Computer Science major at Wright-State University.

## I currently have two working projects.

### The first project I'm working on a combat mod for Dragon Age Inquisition. 
It's goal is to provide better melee combot for the Mage class in the vein of Draogon Age 2, where you could use both single focus and AoE attacks based on enemy range from the player.

### My second project is my first game: "DoG". 
Being made in Unreal Engine 5, it's planned to be a small scale RPG modelled after Final Fantasdy 7. This will be a very small-scale introduction to the world I've crafted. Still at the very least 4 years away, and very likely to take a few years beyond that. It will allow me to test ideas and get player feedback into what areas of the world they would like to see further explored. It also serves as my testing ground as I develop my own skills in programming and beyond to writing, assest/character design, sound design, map design, etc. It currently has 12 minigames planned, on top of a combat system similar to their orignal ATB system with some liberal changes.
